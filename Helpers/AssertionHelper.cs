This file contains the AssertionHelper class, which provides helper methods for performing 
common assertions in Playwright-based tests. These assertions include checking if an element is 
visible, verifying if an element contains a specific text, and confirming if an element is absent 
from the page. The methods use Playwrightâ€™s locator functionality to interact with elements on the page 
and assert expected conditions.
